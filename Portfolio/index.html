                <p>
                    My parents were a Scandinavian Lutheran missionary and a Mexican deacon. They both died when Ignacio was a baby. 
                    Now i am a cook for the Oaxaca monastery orphanage where I was raised. For years I dreamt of becoming a luchador, 
                    but wrestling is strictly forbidden by the monastery as it is a sin of vanity.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I care deeply for the orphans and love them with all my heart. I was getting so angry at the food we provided the children because we cannot afford quality ingredients. 
                    One night, while collecting a bag of donated tortilla chips for the orphans, I was mugged of the chips by a street thief named Steven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After we fought I realized I had to disregard the monastery's rules and become a luchador in order to make money. 
                    After convincing Steven to join me with the promise of monies when we win, I signed us up to a local competition as tag partners.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep my identity secret I became "Nacho", while Steven adopts the name "Esqueleto" (Skeleton).

                After being mugged by a street urchin and losing the children's chips, Ignácio headed to the village with a handful of leftover chips. 
                He throws them into the alleyway where he was previously attacked. He waits behind a wall for the homeless assailant to pounce. 
                He almost succeeds in sneaking up on him, but gives himself away when he breaks wind.
                He tackles the man and they begin to fight. During the fight, Ignácio asks the man if he would join him in the tournament. 
                At first, Steven, the homeless man, ignores the proposition, but after hearing that there is a grand prize of two hundred pesos, he decides to team up with Ignácio.

                They make two makeshift luchador uniforms out of stolen items, train themselves with unusual methods, and then enter into the tournament. 
                Ignácio and Steven now go by the names Nacho and Esqueleto (Nacho is a nickname for Ignácio; Esqueleto means "skeleton" in Spanish which suits malnourished Steven perfectly), 
                and face their first two opponents, El Semental (Ignácio Camarena) and El Pony (Carlos Barroso). Esqueleto is struck down by El Semental, but Nacho gives El Pony a run for his money. 
                At one point, it seems that Nacho and Esqueleto are nearing victory, until Nacho is knocked unconcious by El Semental.

                Nacho tells the monks and Encarnacion about his plan to win the Battle Jam and give his winnings to the orphans for all of their needs. 
                He leaves the orphanage to go to the Battle Jam, where he must fight several fighters all at once. The fighters include Silencio, El Snowflake, Dynasty, El Chino, Muneco, Carlos Rosales, and his trusty companion, Esqueleto. 
                Dynasty, El Snowflake, Muneco, and Carlos Rosales are defeated in the beginning, and Silencio takes out El Chino and Esqueleto at the same time.
            Nacho approaches Silencio but for some odd reason, Muneco trips Nacho from outside of the ring causing Nacho to fall in front of Silencio. Silencio picks Nacho up and then drops him, once again knocking our hero unconcious, also once again leaving him defeated.
